# Take-Home-Test-2.0
a basic blogging web application with a backend and frontend using Django/Python.

Currently as of 4:45 am January 27 2019, I have completed the 5 required functionality/view requirements of:
List view of posts (this should be the home page) 
Detail view of each post 
Create a post with a simple html form (title, description, author, created date) 
Editing a post
Posts should persist using a database to store them (use the default database, SQLite)

Additionally, I have a Post model and Author model.

I do not have any custom styling at the moment. Will do that now until I either drop asleep or complete the project. 
But first its time to upload the project. Well, comment it first.
