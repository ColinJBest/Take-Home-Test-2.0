# Take-Home-Test-2.0
a basic blogging web application with a backend and frontend using Django/Python.

I have completed the 5 required functionality/view requirements of:

List view of posts (this should be the home page) 

Detail view of each post 

Create a post with a simple html form (title, description, author, created date) 

Editing a post

Posts should persist using a database to store them (use the default database, SQLite)

Additionally, I have a Post model and Author model.

I have completed custom styling using boostrap as a base, specifically reboot-bootstrap. I modified the css mostly by wrapping my content in related HTML5 tags, and associating specific css changes with them.

Some shortcomings of my project include: 
- The edit page does not contain the old information on it when it should do that.
- I wanted to make Authors a kind of user, so that blog posts couldn't be posted as any author regardless of user
- I'm not satisfied with my custom styling, has some issues with spacing among other things.
- I don't have error checking


Some personal thoughts and roadblocks:
Hilariously my biggest roadblock was setting up django. I lost the entirety of thursday to trying to set up it, and that isn't an exaggeration.
After that I found that Django was fairly intuitive. And if I couldn't easily find information I needed on their website, Mozilla or another similar website would usually have an answer. 
My other big roadblock was setting up the POST views, but they are relatively simple as it turns out so that was just a me problem.
Overall was a entertaining project that required some quick learning and problem solving.
